# Mark's Drone Demo Project
By Mark Martynenko

My project for demonstrating competency in various aspects of Unity development.

NOTE: This repo comes without Unity Store assets, due to file size limitations and copyright. Use the build available on GDrive to play the game:

This is a short game about flying a drone inside a sci-fi warehouse. Press Esc to see the controls.

There are three rooms in the building:
-A small shader exhibit with 4 simple shaders: A hologram demonstrating a simple surface shader; A colored glass pane using vertex and fragment shaders; A "hypercube" using stencils to show different objects in each different facet; A "plasma ball" which uses a fragment shader to change color based on time.
-A racing track where you can race through waypoints against AI-controlled drones. Simply fly into the marker on the floor and then follow the waypoints for three laps. The AI drones use "virtual pedals" to drive the vehicles as if they were players.
-A warehouse with a maze of shelves, in which an AI drone uses an A* algorithm to find its way. Fly into one of the blue markers to have the drone finds its way to that exit.
